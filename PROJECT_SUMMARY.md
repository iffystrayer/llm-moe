# 🎯 LLM-MoE Project: Complete Analysis and Tutorial

## 📊 Repository Overview

The **LLM-MoE** repository is a research-focused implementation that provides a side-by-side comparison of two fundamental transformer architectures for language modeling:

### 🔬 **What This Project Does**

1. **Standard Transformer**: Traditional dense architecture where all parameters are active for every token
2. **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Sparse architecture that selectively activates expert networks based on input

**Key Research Finding**: MoE achieves **44% better validation loss** while using only **47% of parameters actively**!

## 📈 **Performance Results**

| Architecture | Parameters | Active Params | Val Loss | Val Accuracy | Perplexity | Training Time |
|--------------|------------|---------------|----------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **Standard** | ~29M | 29M (100%) | 0.1365 | 97.66% | 1.15 | 1.9 min |
| **MoE** | ~54M | ~25M (47%) | **0.0758** | **98.57%** | **1.08** | 3.6 min |

### **Key Insights**
- **44% better loss** with MoE vs standard transformer
- **53% parameter efficiency** (fewer active params, better performance)
- **6% improvement** in perplexity (model uncertainty)
- **1.9x training time** due to routing overhead
